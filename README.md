Question 1¶
You work at a college admissions office. When inspecting a dataset of college applicants, you notice that some students have represented their grades with letters ("A", "B", "C", "D", "F"), whereas others have represented their grades with a number between 0 and 100.

You realize that for consistency, all of the grades should be formatted in the same way, and you decide to format them all as letters. For the conversion, you decide to assign:

"A" - any grade 90-100, inclusive
"B" - any grade 80-89, inclusive
"C" - any grade 70-79, inclusive
"D" - any grade 60-69, inclusive
"F" - any grade <60
Write a function get_grade() that takes as input:

score - an integer 0-100 corresponding to a numerical grade
It should return a Python string with the letter grade that it corresponds to. For instance,

A score of 85 corresponds to a B grade. In other words, get_grade(85) should return "B".
A score of 49 corresponds to an F grade. In other words, get_grade(49) should return "F".
Make sure that when supplying the grade that is returned by the function, it is enclosed in quotes. (For instance, if you want to return "A", you should write return "A" and not return A.)
