üå∂Ô∏è Question 5
Say you're doing analytics for a website. You need to write a function that returns the percentage growth in the total number of users relative to a specified number of years ago.

Your function percentage_growth() should take two arguments as input:

num_users = Python list with the total number of users each year. So num_users[0] is the total number of users in the first year, num_users[1] is the total number of users in the second year, and so on. The final entry in the list gives the total number of users in the most recently completed year.
yrs_ago = number of years to go back in time when calculating the growth percentage
For instance, say num_users = [920344, 1043553, 1204334, 1458996, 1503323, 1593432, 1623463, 1843064, 1930992, 2001078].

if yrs_ago = 1, we want the function to return a value of about 0.036. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 3.6%, calculated as (2001078 - 1930992)/1930992.
if years_ago = 7, we would want to return approximately 0.66. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 66%, calculated as (2001078 - 1204334)/1204334.
Your coworker sent you a draft of a function, but it doesn't seem to be doing the correct calculation. Can you figure out what has gone wrong and make the needed changes?
